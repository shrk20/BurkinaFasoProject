            <h2>What's the problem?</h2>
            <p>There is an estimated 75 to 199 million tons of plastic in our oceans today. Approximately 33 billion pounds of plastic enters our marine environment every year. Studies show that we could have more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050. All of this plastic pollutes the ocean, and creates drastic and long-lasting problems that affect everyone. We need to step in now, before it’s too late.
